# CFA-Walker-Instagram

By now every tech literate person knows about Instagram. If not, basically it's a web application that allows users to post photos online. It also allows users to comments on photos, share photos, like photos, etc.

## About the Project

I'm using this to store the code that I develop as I work through Ben Walker's tutorial on creating Instagram in rails. The code will have a bunch of notes through it as it helps me to orientate and remember the relationship between things and the various methods that can be used. 

I'm a beginner at rails. I'm using this tutorial so I can "break" the app each step of the way and learn how to fix it. I like doing this as it gives me a better understanding of the mechanism of rails. If I'm unable to fix what I've broken I'll continue to the next step and be able to fix it with guidance from Walker. 

This is a supplement to what I'm learing at Coder Factory.
